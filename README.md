Flight Navigation Optimization and Risk Mitigation
Problem Statement
We aim to maximize safety and minimize risk in finding the optimal flight route, while also minimizing total cost (extra fuel, API calls, etc.). Additionally, the solution should provide alternate paths for pilots to choose from.

Solution Overview
We convert the problem into a graph problem with a source, destination, and risk factors associated with each node that need to be minimized. Using a time-varying Dijkstra algorithm, we calculate the optimal path while considering these risk factors.

How It Helps
By converting the problem into a graph problem, we can efficiently use well-established algorithms (like Dijkstra) to find the shortest and safest path. The inclusion of time-varying risk factors ensures that the solution adapts to changing conditions, enhancing safety.

Impact Metrics
Weather patterns over an area for a duration of an hour.
Number of planes in the area, which can increase collision risks.
Problem Representation
Each node represents a 10km x 10km square block.
Edges represent the possible 8 directional moves from each node.
Nodes contain risk factors that need to be minimized (weather conditions, plane density).
Technology Stack
Database: SQL/Firebase for storing API call results to reduce costs.
Backend: Python for implementing the risk calculation algorithm.
APIs: Weather API, Plane data API.
Assumptions and Constraints
Planes will not deviate more than 20% from the optimal route.
The maximum flight length is 11,000 km, with a maximum width of 1,100 km.
Risk increases quadratically with the number of planes in a node.
Weather risk follows a sigmoid function.
API calls are cached and reused to save costs.
Maximum flight duration is 18 hours, with a 2-hour buffer for API calls.
Solution Implementation
The solution can be implemented with moderate difficulty, estimated at around 3,000 lines of code.
Using the COCOMO model:
Effort: 2.4 * (3)^1.05 = 8 person-months.
Time: 5 months.
Team size: 2 people.
The solution is effective with an estimated error rate of 10% for risk calculations.
Scalability and Usability
The solution is designed for the worst-case scenario, ensuring scalability.
Cost scaling is proportional to the square of the distance.
